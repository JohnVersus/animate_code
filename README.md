2. **Create Slides**: Use the right panel to define slides with specific line ranges
3. **Preview Animation**: Watch your code animate in the center preview panel
4. **Export Video**: Click export to generate your animated video

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Code Input

- Paste or type your code in the editor
- The system automatically detects the programming language
- Use the language dropdown if manual selection is needed

#### 2. Creating Slides

- Click "Add Slide" to create a new animation slide
- Define line ranges (e.g., "1-5" for lines 1 through 5)
- Use multiple ranges (e.g., "1-3, 5, 8-10") for non-consecutive lines
- Set slide duration and choose animation style
- Reorder slides by dragging them in the list

#### 3. Animation Styles

- **Fade**: Smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
- **Slide**: Lines slide in from different directions
- **Typewriter**: Characters appear one by one
- **Highlight**: Emphasize changes with background colors

#### 4. Preview & Export

- Use play/pause controls to preview your animation
- Navigate between slides manually
- Click "Export" to generate video files
- Choose resolution, frame rate, and format options

### Example Project

Here's a simple JavaScript example to get you started:

```javascript
// Welcome to Code Animator!
function greetUser(name) {
  const greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
  console.log(greeting);
  return greeting;
}

// Call the function
const message = greetUser("World");
console.log("Message:", message);
```
