# Video Export Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Syntax Highlighting

**Problem**: Exported videos had no code colors - all text was plain white.
**Solution**: Updated the video export service to use the existing `canvasRenderer` service which includes proper syntax highlighting with Prism.js integration.

### 2. ✅ Proper Spacing

**Problem**: Line numbers and code content were overlapping with no spacing.
**Solution**: The `canvasRenderer` service handles proper spacing, padding, and layout automatically.

### 3. ✅ Complete Animation

**Problem**: The last frame of the video didn't show all the code.
**Solution**:

- Added a 0.5-second buffer at the end of the video
- Improved animation step calculation to ensure the last step shows all content
- Fixed the line range calculation to show new lines earlier in the animation (progress > 0.1)

### 4. ✅ Proper Canvas Scaling

**Problem**: Content wasn't properly scaled for different video resolutions.
**Solution**:

- Use the canvas renderer to determine proper content sizing
- Scale content to fit target resolution while maintaining aspect ratio
- Center content on the canvas for professional appearance

## Technical Changes

### Updated `src/services/videoExport.ts`:

1. **Integrated Canvas Renderer**: Now uses `canvasRenderer.renderCodeToCanvas()` for consistent styling
2. **Improved Frame Rendering**: Creates temporary canvas for content, then scales to target resolution
3. **Better Animation Logic**: Enhanced `getAnimatedLineRanges()` and `findAnimationStepAtTime()` methods
4. **Added Buffer Time**: Extra 0.5 seconds at the end to ensure complete animation visibility

### Key Methods Modified:

- `renderFrameAtTime()`: Now uses canvas renderer with proper scaling
- `getAnimatedLineRanges()`: Better line visibility logic
- `findAnimationStepAtTime()`: Ensures last step shows all content
- Canvas creation: Proper sizing and scaling calculations

## Testing

You can test the improvements by:

1. Running the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visiting `/test-export` page
3. Clicking the "Export Video" button
4. The exported video should now have:
   - ✅ Proper syntax highlighting colors
   - ✅ Correct spacing between line numbers and code
   - ✅ Complete animation showing all slides
   - ✅ Professional scaling and centering

## Browser Compatibility

The video export uses MediaRecorder API with fallback support:

- Primary format: MP4 (if supported)
- Fallback format: WebM
- Error handling for unsupported browsers
- Quality settings: 5 Mbps bitrate for high-quality output
