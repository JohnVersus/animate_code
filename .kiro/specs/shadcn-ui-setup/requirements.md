# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up shadcn/ui component library in the existing Next.js project to provide a consistent, accessible, and well-designed UI component system. Since shadcn/ui now uses Tailwind CSS v4, this also includes migrating the project from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4. The integration will replace custom UI components with shadcn/ui components and establish a foundation for future UI development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Tailwind CSS v3 to v4, so that the project is compatible with the latest shadcn/ui components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tailwind CSS v4 is installed THEN the system SHALL remove v3 dependencies and install v4
2. WHEN the migration occurs THEN existing Tailwind configuration SHALL be updated to v4 format
3. WHEN v4 is configured THEN all existing styles SHALL continue to work without breaking changes
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the build process SHALL use Tailwind CSS v4

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate shadcn/ui into the project, so that I can use pre-built, accessible UI components instead of building custom ones from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shadcn/ui CLI is installed THEN the system SHALL have access to shadcn/ui component generation commands
2. WHEN shadcn/ui is initialized THEN the system SHALL create the necessary configuration files (components.json, lib/utils.ts updates)
3. WHEN shadcn/ui is configured THEN the system SHALL support TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4 integration
4. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL be able to add new shadcn/ui components via CLI commands

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace existing custom UI components with shadcn/ui equivalents, so that the application has consistent styling and improved accessibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing custom components are identified THEN the system SHALL map them to appropriate shadcn/ui components
2. WHEN shadcn/ui components are installed THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the Tailwind CSS v4 setup
3. WHEN custom components are replaced THEN the application SHALL maintain the same functionality
4. WHEN components are updated THEN all imports and references SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shadcn/ui components to work with the existing project structure, so that I can maintain consistency with current development patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shadcn/ui components are added THEN they SHALL be placed in the src/components/ui directory
2. WHEN components are imported THEN they SHALL follow the existing import patterns in the project
3. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL be compatible with the Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
4. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN shadcn/ui components SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a component library foundation, so that future UI development follows consistent patterns and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new UI components are needed THEN developers SHALL be able to add them using shadcn/ui CLI
2. WHEN components are customized THEN the customizations SHALL be maintainable and documented
3. WHEN the component system is in place THEN it SHALL support theming and design system consistency
4. WHEN components are used THEN they SHALL provide accessible markup and behavior by default
